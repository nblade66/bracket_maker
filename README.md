Run with `python -m BracketMaker.cli_h2h`.
I got the bts playlist ("data/complete_bts_discography.csv") from https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ofZ4VaQrKkgE8KaDKxP1b?si=V1JsibuzS669Gd30ngfv9Q&pi=EnHxvW9yTOuOE&nd=1&dlsi=1a653f0c27944850 (from reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/1l04vet/a_complete_guide_to_bts_discography_from_debut_to/) and exported to a csv file using https://exportify.net/.

TODO:
* Feature to save the bracket and come back to it later
* Feature to reset the bracket to round 1 or reset the round
* Front end for click selection and nicer UI
* Ability to play a short clip of the song
